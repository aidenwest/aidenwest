1) How did you get started with the field of data analysis?
    I got started after working on my thesis in university. I had to learn R and coding basics to be able to clean, maipulate, and run statical analysis we were running to analyse the study we conducted.

2) What aspect of data intrigues you the most?
    The unlimited posibilites. The blank canvas. Putting up a magnifyglass to something and widdling away at it to create something beautiful. And that beautiful visual can convery things far more than words.
    
3) What are your areas of interest with respect to data analytics?
    I am interested in geo data, real estate, finance, and health data.
